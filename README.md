# Word_Frequency_in_Moby_Dick_IN_Python

Project Description 
==================== 
In this Project, you'll scrape the novel Moby Dick from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests. Then you'll extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally, we'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk). The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text.

To complete this project, you need to know how to import web data into python and how to work with natural language text. Before starting this project its recommend that you have completed the knowledges of :

i) Importing Data in Python (Part 2).
ii) Natural Language Processing Fundamentals in Python.

How to Open notebook.ipynb Project File 
=======================================  

i) Free download and install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/ based upon your computer's operating system.

ii) After downloading Anaconda, Launch "Jupyter Notebook" from Start Menu -> Anaconda.

iii) Move to the directory on "Jupyter Notebook" where you have stored the .ipynb file.

iv) Double click to open the File on "Jupyter Notebook" software.

v) The Jupyter notebook shall reside under the folder "Word_Frequency_in_Moby_Dick_IN_Python". 
   You can download the Word_Frequency_in_Moby_Dick_IN_Python.zip file and unzip at your favorite location to see the notebook.

vi) The datasets which are used on this project shall reside under the folder Word_Frequency_in_Moby_Dick_IN_Python\_\datasets

vii) All the required images shall reside under folder Word_Frequency_in_Moby_Dick_IN_Python\_\img
